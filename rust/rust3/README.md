# Writeup
**This CTF challenge is based on Rust's support of UTF-8 encoding in string types like [str](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html) and [String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html).**

**The aim of this challenge is to figure out the correct *" password "*.** 

The user is asked for an input with a window of 10 seconds.

```rust
println!("\nEnter the password to get the ğŸš©: ");
```

 This input is trimmed and stored in the `password` variable. The number of bytes that the password can have is limited to less than 12 bytes to handle an unintended method of solving this challenge.

``` rust
let password = input.trim();

if password.as_bytes().len() >= 12 {
    println!("Nice Try ğŸ‘»");
    return;
} 
```

The number of bytes is printed, encouraging the player to think in that direction i.e UTF-8 encoding where single characters can take up multiple bytes.
```rust
println!("\nWhat's this??? ğŸ¤” \"{}\"\n", password.as_bytes().len());
``` 

The main logic of the challenge is in the `do_something()` function.

```rust
fn do_something(password: &str) -> String {
        let mut some_string = String::new();
        
        for byte in password.bytes() {
            byte
            .to_string()
            .chars()
            .for_each(|ch| {
                some_string.push(char::from_u32(ch.to_digit(10).expect("Valid Digit") + 90 ).expect("Valid ASCII code"))
            });
        }
        
        some_string
    }
```
**Explanation of `do_something` :**
- Takes in an `&str` as an argument. Creates a String `some_string` which will be returned.

- Iterates the bytes in the password using the `.bytes()` method of the str type which returns an [Iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) of the byte sequence with base 10 (Decimal).

- In the loop, the number stored in a byte is converted to a String ( u8 to String ) using the `.to_string()` method and then the `.chars()` method is used to get an Iterator over it's individual characters, so in our case we get the individual digits of the original number stored in the byte.

- Then we use the `.for_each()` method to map a [closure](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html) over the Iterator i.e for each character in the Iterator, do something (closure) with it. The closure we have defined takes in the char from the Iterator as an argument `ch` and in the closure body we can see that some char is getting pushed into `some_string`.

- **This is the crux of the challenge :** 
    ```rust
    some_string.push(char::from_u32(ch.to_digit(10).expect("Valid Digit") + 90 ).expect("Valid ASCII code"))
    ```

- Going from inside out, `ch.to_digit(10)` converts the char to an integer ( char to u32 where char should be a valid digit i.e. '1', '0' etc) and 90 is added to whatever number we get. Then `char::from_u32()` gets the corresponding character using the number ( digit + 90 ) as the ASCII value. So for example,

    > '0' will be converted to 0 and then 90 will be added to get 90 which will become 'Z'. 

    > '4' will be converted to 4 and then 90 will be added to get 94 which will become '^'.

- The character we get is then pushed into `some_string`. After the iterations are over `some_string` is returned.


Next we apply the `do_something` function to the `password` we get from the player and store it in `some_string`. We also have an `expected_string` whose value is hardcoded. 

```rust
let some_string = do_something(password);
let expected_string = r"\^Z[_c[``[\b".to_string();
```

We then compare both the Strings

```rust
if some_string == expected_string {
        println!("{flag}\n");
    }
else {
    println!("Think a bit more creativelyâ˜•");
}
```
 
 If both the Strings are equal the flag is printed which is taken from [`flag.txt`](/src/flag.txt).

 So what we have to do is reverse the raw String `\^Z[_c[``[\b`.

 If we apply the reverse of the steps in the `do_something` function which is getting the ASCII value for each char in the String and subtracting 90 from it we should get the original byte numbers. 

 So for the String `\^Z[_c[``[\b` we get the numbers `240159166128` which is 12 digits.

 If we simply apply the steps in `do_something` to these numbers considering each digit as one byte and feed the resulting String into the program, the program will stop as the password entered should have less then 12 bytes. 

Looking into UTF-8 encodings, UTF-8 can encode 1,112,064 valid Unicode code points using one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units.

If we look at `240159166128` as four bytes we get the values `240 159 166 128`.

After putting these values into a UTF-8 to Unicode converter we get:

**The result we get is the *crab emoji*  `ğŸ¦€`  which is the password**

If we input `ğŸ¦€` as the password, the flag will be printed.

### **Flag: quarkCTF{3m0j1s_4r3_7h3_n3w_h13r09lyph1c5}**

## Unpatched unintended solution: 

If we take pairs from the numbers `240159166128` as `24 01 59 16 61 28`, convert these numbers to a string taking each pair as one byte i.e. we get 6 bytes and input the resulting string into the program, the flag will be revealed. 

The corrected check for the number of bytes should be: 

```rust
if password.as_bytes().len() >= 6 {
    println!("Nice Try ğŸ‘»");
    return;
} 
```
